# ComparativeGraphModel
Unsupervised facial recognition technique via similarity based data cleaning.

This directory contains code for an implementation of the Comparative Graph Model algorithm. The main algorithm is found under "NEW_TEST.vb" and other .vb files are supporting files that are needed for the algorithm. The algorithm in this code is set up for a training set of ten images, however it is easily extended to be N images.
